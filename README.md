# Ticket Management System

## Introduction
This project is a Ticket Management System designed to simplify the process of managing tickets for various purposes. It consists of both frontend and backend components.

## Frontend
The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a modern and interactive user interface for interacting with the ticket management system.

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- React Router (for routing)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- React Toastify (for displaying notifications)

### Project Structure
- **src/components**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **src/pages**: Contains individual pages/components for different routes of the application.
- **src/context**: Contains React context for managing authentication.
- **src/services**: Contains utility functions or API service files for making HTTP requests.
- **src/utils**: Contains utility functions used across the application.
- **src/App.js**: Main entry point of the React application.
- **src/index.js**: Renders the React application into the DOM.

## Backend
The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing the server-side logic and API endpoints for handling ticket-related operations.

### Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js (for building the server)
- MongoDB (as the database)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)

### Project Structure
- **server.js**: Main entry point of the backend server.
- **config**: Contains configuration files for setting up environment variables.
- **models**: Contains Mongoose models for defining database schemas.
- **routes**: Contains route handlers for different API endpoints.
- **middleware**: Contains custom middleware functions for handling requests.
